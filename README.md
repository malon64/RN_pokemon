# RN_Pokemon
A simple React Native project showing a list of the first generation Pokemons.

I used expo.io and next.js to build this minimal app that can be tested on Android, IOS and Web Navigator.

# Execution
Run expo start in the line command if you already have expo installed
```bash
expo start
```
If not you can install expo with npm or yarn
```bash
yarn add expo
npm i expo
```
